# Spotify Clone 🎵

This project is a basic music player web application inspired by Spotify. It allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a list of songs, complete with a progress bar and play/pause animations.

---

## Features 🚀

- **Play/Pause Songs:** Start or stop the currently selected song.
- **Song Navigation:** Move to the next or previous song in the playlist.
- **Dynamic Song List:** Displays song details like name, cover image, and duration dynamically.
- **Seek Bar:** A progress bar to skip to a specific part of the song.
- **Responsive UI:** Adapts to different screen sizes.

---

## Project Structure 📂

The project consists of three main files:

1. **HTML (spotify.html):**  
   - Contains the structure of the webpage.
   - Displays the navigation bar, song list, and controls.

2. **CSS (spotify.css):**  
   - Adds styling to make the webpage visually appealing.
   - Implements a responsive layout and transitions.

3. **JavaScript (spotify1.js):**  
   - Handles the logic for playing songs, updating the progress bar, and switching between tracks.

---

## How It Works 🤔

1. **Song List:**  
   Songs are defined in an array within the JavaScript file, with details like the name, file path, and cover image.

2. **Play/Pause Functionality:**  
   Clicking the play button starts the song and changes the button to a pause icon. Clicking pause stops the song.

3. **Progress Bar:**  
   - Automatically updates as the song plays.  
   - Users can drag it to skip to a specific part of the song.

4. **Next/Previous Controls:**  
   Navigate between songs using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML:** For creating the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS:** For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity and managing the music player logic.
